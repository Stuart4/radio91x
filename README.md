# radio91x
Material streaming client for San Diego's 91x radio station.
# TODO
- Convert the streaming components into a service in order to operate without MainActivity
- Use a local proxy server to get song information from the stream source without creating a new connection in order to fix the stream getting out of sync with the parser task
